# GSOC Project 2
This is an activity for the Sugarizer Platform. Built using Threejs to render the 3D scene. This activity will help students visualize the human body and its organs. Students will also be able to interact with the various parts of the human body. To run the application you can follow the following steps - 

If you're a developer you could also launch Sugarizer desktop application using [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron). First, install Node.js and npm on your computer. See [here](http://nodejs.org/) for more information. Then install electron and specific modules for Sugarizer by running:

	npm install

Then launch Sugarizer for GNU Linux with:

	npm start > /dev/null

Or, for Mac OS/Windows, just:

	npm start

You could use Sugarizer desktop arguments using "--" after start. For example:

	npm start -- --window

To run locally **Sugarizer Application into the Web Browser** (GNU Linux/Mac OS/Windows), you should launch it with a special option to enable access to local files.

For **Chrome**, close ALL running instances of Chrome and re-launch it using the command line:

 	chrome --allow-file-access-from-files file:\\\<Directory>\sugarizer\index.html

In the path above, `<Directory>` is where you have stored/cloned your sugarizer repo into.

In Windows, \ is the way path is written and / is the way for Linux/MacOS backward and forward slashes differ here, hence path for Linux/MacOS will be:

	chrome --allow-file-access-from-files file:///<Directory>/sugarizer/index.html
On Windows, you should launch:

	"C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" --allow-file-access-from-files <path>

On Mac OS, you should launch:

	open -n /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app --args --allow-file-access-from-files <path>

On Linux, you should launch:

	google-chrome-stable --allow-file-access-from-files <path>

> Note: `google-chrome-stable` is the name of Chrome in Ubuntu but it could be different on other distribution, you can get the package-name for Chrome by running `sudo dpkg -l | grep chrome`

For **Firefox**, type in the address bar:

    about:config

Search for the `security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy` parameter and
set it to `false`.

For **Safari** go to the `Safari/Preferences...` menu, under Advanced panel check the *Show develop menu in menu bar* box. Then from the `Develop` menu, select *Disable local file restrictions*.
